name: hyderogen-package
title: Build jekyll sites
description: |-
  hyderogen provides a toolset for quickly building Jekyll projects from your
  package's roxygen. These tools focus on creating detailed front matter and
  plain templates. You can then further customize these templates. When you
  update your roxygen you can rebuild your Jekyll front matter, while leaving
  the templates untouched.

  This package is a work in progress. If you try it out please do not be shy
  about reporting bugs or less-than-ideal results. All feedback is welcome at
  [nteetor/hyderogen/issues](https://github.com/nteetor/hyderogen).
