# hyderogen

Turn your existing roxygen documentation into a jekyll site.

## How it works

- [x] `@family`s are converted into collections
- [x] blocks without a `@family` tag are converted into pages
- [ ] generate default jekyll files and folder structure
- [ ] generate default templates for collections
- [ ] collect extra meta data for front matter

## Why?

It's a toolset useful to me and I happen to like jekyll.
